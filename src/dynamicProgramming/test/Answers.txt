Q2: If we can solve a problem by combining the solutions to its sub-problems, does that mean
that we can solve it with a DP algorithm?
Yes, dp is used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and solving each sub-problem only once,
saving the solutions of sub-problems

Q3: In the Edit-Distance algorithm, when we do an insertion operation, why do we need to look at the Edit-Distance of
the previous character position of the second string?.
We need to looking at the edit distance of the previous character position of the second string, to make decisions
about the current cell and accurately calculate the cost of the insertion operation.
